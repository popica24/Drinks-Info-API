# API Consuming Template Basically

I worked with third-party data, a very common way of accessing external vendor’s data. I made requests to their APIs (Application Programming Interface). Once I accessed their data, I can process it in my application to suit my needs. Another common scenario is when an organisation has multiple independent applications that communicate amongst themselves. The so called microservices.

In this application I connected to an external API through HTTP requests using .NET’s class library. Luckily there are many public APIs out there. Here’s a great list of public [APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) I used for practice.
